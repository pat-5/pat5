The quick brown fox jumped over
the extremely lazy dogs.

Then a horse arrived.  It was extremely angry.
Outside, two bears [were fighting](http://google.com) each other.

Also present at _the intense %hoon scene_ were:

- an Armenian.

- a haberdasher.

  A haberdasher is someone who makes hats.  There are quite
  a few kinds of hats:

  - fedoras

  - borsalinos

  - sombreros

  - baseball caps

  All these devices will protect    your bald spot from the rain.

  It is _sometimes difficult_ to be a bald man when it's raining.

We sometimes speak in %hoon  We also say 0xdead.beef things like ~ and #`@`2.

We don't care if we sound funny, and sometimes we !@#$%%#^? cuss.

```
We also sometimes put
in
code
looks

like
this.
