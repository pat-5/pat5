## A digital home base

What you need is a digital home base.  What is that computer?  Is
it (a) your phone, (b) your browser, (c) your PC or laptop, (d)
your AWS instance, (e) your RasPi or other custom home computer?

Here are three obvious features your digital home base needs.
(1) it should be infinitely secure and persistent -- at the level
of Amazon S3, Gmail, your bank, etc.  (2) it should be a server,
not just a client.  (3) it should be usable by ordinary people.

Everything except (d) falls far short of (1) and/or (2).  (d)
falls far short of (3).

The missing piece is a practical _personal server_ -- a virtual
computer in the cloud, with persistence guarantees comparable to
cloud storage services, that's as completely yours as a RasPi.
